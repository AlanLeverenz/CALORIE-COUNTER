# CALORIE-COUNTER

## Plain Vanilla JavaScript App

### Description

This app is sourced from the 'Modern JavaScript' class authored by Brad Traversy, used as an exercise for studying use of the JavaScript Singleton module type, which is loaded when the app is launched.

There are four controllers in the app.js file:

* Storage Controller
  
* Item Controller

* UI Controller

* App Controller

It uses Local Storage to persist data entered by the user. The HTML layout consists of a simple form, total calories, and the list of food items and their calories. All CRUD functions are included for modifying the data.
